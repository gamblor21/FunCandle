# FunCandle

Turn your Adafruit Funhouse into a virtual birthday cupcake and candle you can blow out!

The project will play a GIF of a cupcake with a lit candle. Attach a SHT40 sensor to detect
breath (by increasing humidty) and the candle blows out!

For extra fun the middle button will play Happy Birthday through the speaker.

Place the two GIF files in the `normal` folder on your root CircuitPython drive.

The water folder has optional GIFs, that instead of showing the candle blown out it is put out
by dousing it with water.
